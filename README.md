First of all, thanks for the interest! HospitalAid is a young project, and it needs your help on many fronts.

These are the guidelines for contributing code:

- HospitalAid project is in a discovery phase. Features are likely to change. Please do not get attached to your code.
- Every feature that lowers the friction of users contributing Aid requests (and responses) to our system is welcome, but needs to be Ok-ed by @Victor and @Bhavaani
- Software engineers are deep thinkers. Please use your mental power to think about how our users use (or could use) the system.
- The project is using Django. Django is extremely well-documented. Please go online and familiarize yourself with it.
- Please discuss any technical infrastructure change with @fmarani
- Everytime you change the code, please submit a Pull request. Do not contribute code that breaks existing functionality. Commit automated tests if you can.
- Please submit small Pull requests. Anything that takes more than a few hours should be discussed first.
- Format all code using isort and Black (python code formatters)


Areas of contribution that are welcome
---

- automated tests (integration/unit tests)
- convert designs to HTML/CSS
- research similar tech projects and see if we can reuse data/ideas/code
